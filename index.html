        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Determining the core values of your company or the client you're working for can help you design multiple aspects of a website. A core value is a fundamental belief of a person or organization, and these can guide your design choices, such as for the function of the website, your target audience, specific features you may add and the general image that you want the site to portray. You can hold meetings with your client, talk to your supervisor or brainstorm independently to list some core values that you can use to inform your website design process.</p>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>You or someone you're working with might want the website for a variety of reasons.

            <h4>6. Is this a website redesign?</h4>

            <h4>7. What image do you want your site to portray?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
        </div>

            <p>Creating an image or general feel of your website can give the brand or organization associated with the site an enhanced sense of identity and may attract more visitors.

            <h4>8. Do you have any brand elements you need on your website?</h4>
            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>
        </div>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Brand elements are particular elements that people associate with your brand, such as logos, taglines, color schemes or images. If there are brand elements you want on your website, you can use them to inform other design decisions. For example, if the ice cream company you're making a site for has a vanilla ice cream cone logo, you may create a website with a darker background so that you can see the logo clearly.</p>

            <i class="icon fa-solid fa-angle-down"></i>

        <div class="answer">
            <p>When designing a website, you may want to ask yourself what technical specifications your site may need to perform properly. For example, if the website has graphics, music and multiple pages with various features, it may require more bandwidth than a site that only contains a background and text. Try to think about your technical capacity in advance to ensure that your website runs smoothly.</p>
